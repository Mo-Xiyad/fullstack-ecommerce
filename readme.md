To deploy backend Run the following:

- cd into the root dir and run genezio.yaml file
- you dont have to run the build command, since genezio will handle that.
- run `genezio deploy`

That will take the backend and package it in a serverless function and deploy it on genezio.
and now you can get the api url from there.
